# Product Ordering

Your task is to simulate a product listing page like you would find on Etsy, Amazon, or Ebay. This application should implement the following features.

1. Display a product. Each product should have a title, short description, price, quantity, and an image.
1. Display the application information in a navigation bar at the top of the page.
    1. The name of the company - Betsy
    1. Three links: *Categories*, *Orders*, and *Log Out*
1. Display 3 product reviews beneath the product listing. You can use [hipster ipsum](https://hipsum.co/) for the reviews themselves.

Each of those features is a separate component, and you must write your code as modular as possible with Browserify.

1. One module contains the product information (i.e. productFactory)
1. One module displays the product information (i.e. product Controller)
1. One module builds the navigation bar
1. One module contains the review information (i.e. reviewFactory)
1. One module displays the review information (i.e. reviewController)
