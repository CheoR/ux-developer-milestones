## Setup

## Prerequisite

It is recommended that you complete [version 10](../2-intermediate/MF_MUSIC_HISTORY.md) exercise before starting this one.

### Create a new branch

`git checkout -b version11`

## Requirements

### Song List View

Now you will add the filtering form back into your Angularized Music History application that you did in version 10.

Use the built-in directives that Angular provides to display the list of albums and/or list of artists in your filter form. When the user selects an album or artist, filter the collection of songs that is being displayed based on the user's selection.
