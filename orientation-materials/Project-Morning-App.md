## Deliverables
Submit the following

### Phase 1
* Tickets (Issues) in Github for your team
* Project Plan Outline (who's doing what and by when this week).  You donâ€™t need to go into exhaustive depth about every step, but keeping the plan in mind can help your team impose order on chaos if things start feeling like they are slipping away.
* Be sure each deliverable and ticket is in your plan.
* Give yourself time to practice your presentation.

Give your instructor access to your spreadsheet

### Phase 2
* Site Map
* Key Tasks: List the ones that you decided to build in the MVP.
* Screen Sketches
* Wireframe Prototype (Mid-Fidelity, B&W and interactive in prototyping software). Share links with instructor.
* Results/Findings from assessment or interview on prototype and how you applied those results to your MVP (can be a casual interview - just show it to somebody!)
* Code: MVP (be sure to hit all the points for the project, including the required Github issue tickets)
* Github README.md
* Final Presentation with typical lessons learned. Also be prepared to explain changes you learned from user test(s) to the final MVP.

### Design Stretch Goals
* Journey Map
* Heuristics Evaluation of your MVP
* Usability Test (Prototype or MVP) - with full protocol and metrics for results
