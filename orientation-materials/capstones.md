# Capstones
Think of your capstone presentation as a case study. Present it as a milestone with your client; tell them a story from challenge, through prototype and testing to the MVP code. You will use this material for your online portfolio, too.

Sample case studies do not go into MVP code. Remember to include the method and general decisions you made with your code.

## Design Checklist
Your capstone should demonstrate that you are following a process and that you have researched and validated your assumptions at each design step along the way.

* **Challenge** Statement: What problem are you solving?
* **Personas**: Who are you target users? Customers?
* **Competition/Inspiration**: Did you find other good and bad ways to solve your problem? Or to distract your user away from your solution?
* **Insights & Themes**: What have you learned from your interviews and other research?
* **Journey Map**: How does your user solve this problem now? And/or, how do they use your app/site?
* **Key Features**: What key features have you identified that support what you have learned? (You won't necessarily have them all in your MVP!!!)
* **Prototype**: From fidelity sketches to high-fidelity interactive designs, be able to explain your logic for your design decisions. The prototype demonstrates how you designed a solution, not coded something to match your code skills.
* **Style Guide**: What is the voice and tone of your design? How do your colors, fonts, images reflect that?

### Design Influence on Trustworthiness

There is a famous psych study from about 15 years ago on how design and content influences user's feelings of trust of online health sites. Ten years ago, this was a new idea. There were many questions about security, reliability, credibility and appropriateness of communicating with patients via the inner-webs. (real and imagined). The study found that a good web design can actually make your website more trustworthy. The white paper is available if you'd like to read it. Here are some bullet points to summarize their findings so you can apply them to your capstone:

The study found that when describing why participants mistrusted a website, 94% of the comments were design-related. Only 6% of the reasons for distrusting a website were content-related. Websites with bad design will be dismissed quickly, even if the content is great.

* Complex, busy layout – Unusual layouts were cited as being less trustworthy. Study participants trusted the sites with expected layouts and clear navigation.
* Boring web design (especially use of color) – One of the participants had this to say about a mistrusted website, “And one of them I didn’t like the color of. I couldn’t wait to get out it was an insipid green backdrop it just put me off reading it.”
* Pop-up & Flashy Ads – Most people find pop-up ads so annoying that they hurt your website’s credibility.
* Slow Performance – Users abandon clunky and slow sites and apps; it raises questions on the viability of the business.
* Small print – Don’t hide the content people came to your app or site for in the first place. A lot of cramped content, terrible alignment, broken spaces, lack of order and random size of elements evoked irritation. Make sure the content on your website is informative, easy to read and relevant to the topic (you may think your quirky photos are funny but no one else may get the joke). Content includes text, images, video, and audio.
* Bad, Kitschy Typography – Tight lettering, thick strokes, all-caps, random styles, blackletter or old type styles put users off
* Non-responsive Layouts – Non-responsive layouts that make viewing the web pages on smaller screens almost impossible looks careless.

Build Trust with:
* Wide variety of topics
* Unbiased information
* Target Audience (Persona)-specific design and information
* Clear, simple language
* Discussion groups
* Frequently asked questions
