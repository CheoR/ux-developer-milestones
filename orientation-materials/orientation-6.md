## 5 Steps for Journey Map
Great starting points
1. **Actions**. At a high-level, describe what action the persona takes to reach the outcome.
2. **Touchpoints**. Encounters that happen between your business and users/customers (not just your website/app, consider user calling support, looking at other sites, etc.). This way you’ll discover the landscape you are in from the customer’s perception.
3. **Equipment/Resources**. The items or services the person really needs to complete that step in this journey. Don’t list everything (ex. computer or smart phone)
4. **Emotions**. How did the user felt at that moment? Can use a scale from 0 to 10. The higher the number, the better the experience. This can be visualized (e.g. by a line going up and down)
5. **Moments of Truth**. AHA! Things that stand out - good and bad. Capture problems and ideas.

User journeys requires plenty of research and teamwork. You interview multiple people and then prune the findings to come up with one typical journey.

## Practice
1. Find an examples of one B2B and one. B2C e-commerce sites.
2. Create a [Heuristics Evaluation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BtlzDNNX1ZSEnhmGpvMkZmtAwFtaCjewU7BH817nJPk/edit?usp=sharing) report for each. This can be a Google Doc.
3. Include a summary identifying key differences between the two sites that pertains to their customers (i.e., what makes one site a B2B and one site a B2C other than the items they are selling? How do they handle pricing? Integrations? Regulations?)
4. You may find that the site is missing key elements as you begin the evaluation. That's fine! In your report, identify the things that are missing and explain why they are important or should have been included.
