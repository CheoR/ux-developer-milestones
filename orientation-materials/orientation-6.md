## Practice
1. Find an examples of one B2B and one. B2C e-commerce sites.
1. Create a [Heuristics Evaluation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BtlzDNNX1ZSEnhmGpvMkZmtAwFtaCjewU7BH817nJPk/edit?usp=sharing) report for each. This can be a Google Doc.
1. Include a summary identifying key differences between the two sites that pertains to their customers (i.e., what makes one site a B2B and one site a B2C other than the items they are selling? How do they handle pricing? Integrations? Regulations?)
1. You may find that the site is missing key elements as you begin the evaluation. That's fine! In your report, identify the things that are missing and explain why they are important or should have been included.
