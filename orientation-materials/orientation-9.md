## ROI of UX:
* [The ROI of User Experience, Human Factors International](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O94kYyzqvTc) [video 5 min] [Posters available](http://www.humanfactors.com/whitepapers/ROI_of_user_experience.asp)
* [HEART Framework: How to Choose the Right UX Metrics](https://library.gv.com/how-to-choose-the-right-ux-metrics-for-your-product-5f46359ab5be)  [7 min read]
* [How to Calculate the ROI of UX Using Metrics](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2012/07/how-to-calculate-the-roi-of-ux-using-metrics.php) From Susan, "This one is kind of a snoozer to get through but gives you how to steps on calculating ROI. It's from 2012 but it still works for me! Bookmark this one to use after your first paid project to demonstrate the value of your contribution." [10 min read]

## Usability Testing
* [Remote Usability Tests: Moderated and Unmoderated - Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/remote-usability-tests/) - bookmark it because they include a list of services
* [Usability Testing Can be Fun](https://userbrain.net/blog/usability-can-actually-be-fun): The first video on the usability of fruit is funny but actually a pretty good summary of a good usability test!
* [$0 usability testing guide in 7 steps](https://medium.com/humbleteam/0-usability-testing-guide-in-7-steps-a3fc94b4f729) Not the best approach (lacks objectivity if only testing with friends and colleagues) but it is a good explanation of how to structure questions to avoid bias. (And testing with colleagues and friends is better than none at all!)
* [Eye Tracking: What it is and when to use it](https://usabilitygeek.com/what-is-eye-tracking-when-to-use-it/)
