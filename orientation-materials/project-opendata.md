# Project Open Data

As part of Metroâ€™s Open Data Initiative, the Nashville Open Data Portal is the destination for the public to access Metro Government data. Datasets are available to empower the public to partner with Metro Government to co-create innovative web resources, insightful analytics on public programs and services, and new civic apps for the community.

## Propose a Project
Review the information found at the Nashville Open Data resource. Work individually or in a group (max 3 people) to propose a meaningful way to present or utilize one of the open data sources. Your proposal should be doable with the data available. 

### Utilize your UI/UX Skills
* Research
* Define the problem
* Challenge statement
* Consider constraints
* Ask questions: interview users
* Persona(s)
* Incorporate a poll/survey
* Wireframes
* Prototype and user feedback
* Presentation skills

## Pitch Your Project
In the spirit of a Hack-A-Thon, present your proposed project to the class with the intent of getting developers to join your team. You will have 5 minutes to pitch your project and then the class will have an opportunity to ask questions. 

You will want to be as thorough as possible with your research and information. Ultimately, this will guide the build process.   

## Vote
Once all proposals have been presented, voting will ensue to determine which project(s) will be built. 

## Join
You will have an opportunity to express interest in the projects. However we will keep the teams balanced.

## Build
Over the course of a 10 day sprint apply technical and UI/UX skills to develop a V1 of the project. The team should create tickets and then decide what can be built during the time frame. Create a timeline for progress and define the responsibilities for team members. A case study documenting the process should be included as well as a complete README.md. 

## Final Presentations
The projects will be presented to the class and invited guests. You will have 8 minutes for presentation. This will need to include UI/UX information as well as a demonstration of the coded project.
