## Practice
1. Get to Know Fonts
   Using Google Fonts, decide on three sets of pairings you can declare as your 'Go To' font options. For each pairing, choose a headline and body font. Display each on an HTML. Be prepared to share with the class and defend your choices.

2. Explore Different Typography and Color Choices with Your Journal

Try experimenting with some different font pairings for your headings and body text and see how they change the look and feel of the content.

Once you have the styles working correctly, ask yourself what changes do the new typefaces suggest? Do you need to adjust the size and or the line height? What about other styles such as bolding and Italic?

Once you have something youâ€™re happy with, share with class (slack)
