# Individual Challenges - Test what you know. Can you do them?

## Challenge #1

Create a form that has a range input, and a number input, both with the same values for min, max, and default. When the user changes the value on the range input, the value of the number input should match. The opposite should be true. The values of the two inputs should always be synchronized.

## Challenge #2: Interactive navigation bar

Create a navigation bar out of an unordered list element, and add the following interactivity.

1. When the user hovers over one of the links, the color of the text should change.
1. When the user hovers over one of the links, the background color of the element that contains the link should change.
1. When the user clicks on one of the links, the element that contains the link should grow in size by 5px on the left and right.

## Challenge #3: Sticky navigation bar

You will learn more about how to do this in CSS102, but if you want a challenge now, create a web page that has a navigation bar and plenty of articles so that the content goes well below the fold (fancy term for the amount of real estate that exists when the user first loads the page).

When the user scrolls now to read the rest of the content, the navigation bar should remain at the top of the page, always visible, no matter how far down the user scrolls.

## Challenge #4

What is the smallest number  that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder?

## Challenge #5

Write a [Fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) generator that outputs the numbers in the series that are less than 500.

## Challenge #6

What is the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers, and the square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers?

## Challenge #7

Your challenge is to replicate the shapes, and the animations that you see in the animated GIF below. You must **only use CSS**. No JavaScript and no images.

## Challenge #8: Happy Number

Write out 143 happy numbers up to 1,000. A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number either equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers (or sad numbers).

### Dare YOU
Using an object constructor, display each happy number within an HTML element with a systematic background color style, and the ability to click on each one resulting in a console log of the number value.


## Challenge #9: CSS Zen Garden

Visit http://www.csszengarden.com/ and explore some of the designs.

You will create your own version of the CSS Zen Garden.

Download the HTML and CSS files.  
:paperclip: [HTML](http://www.csszengarden.com/examples/index)  
:paperclip: [CSS](http://www.csszengarden.com/examples/style.css)  

Copy the contents of the HTML file into your `index.html`.  
Copy the contents of the CSS file into your `styles.css`.  

> The only rule: you may only change the CSS; not the HTML.

> :pencil2:  In an effort to keep this project like the Zen Garden website, this exercise does not have a styles folder.

> Proud of your work? Sumbit it to the Zen Garden website.
