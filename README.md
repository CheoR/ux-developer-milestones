# Building a foundation in the methods used in front-end web design and development with UI/UX.

Welcome. During the next two months you will be introduced to UI/UX techniques and ideas used in Front-End development. You will use these skills and knowledge to build front-end projects with an emphasis on the user.

At the end of this journey, you will be expected to demonstrate front-end development skills based on user feedback. An online portfolio is required and will include case studies demonstrating user inclusion as well as a comprehensive capstone that incorporates user feedback goals.

* Your Portfolio itself
* Front-End Capstone and Case Study - challenge statement, persona, user testing, and conclusion/summary of findings.
* Journal - React, Firebase, CSS Library, challenge statement, persona, user testing,  wireframes, mockups, and conclusion/summary.
* Cohort Website and Case Study - challenge statement, persona, wireframes, mockups, user testing/feedback, conclusion.
* Project - applied technology and user goals.
* Backend Capstone and Case Study - challenge statement, research/competitive analyst, persona, wireframes, mockups, user testing/feedback, conclusion.
